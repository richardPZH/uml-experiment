% has the following fields: 
%
% K: how many components does the mixture have
% ALPHA: How fast to adapt the component weights
% RHO: How fast to adapt the component means and covariances
% DEVIATION_SQ_THRESH: Threshold used to find matching versus
%   unmatching components. 
% INIT_VARIANCE: Initial variance for newly placed components
% INIT_MIXPROP: Initial prior for newly placed components
% COMPONENT_THRESH: Filter out connected components of smaller size
% BACKGROUND_THRESH: Percentage of weight that must be accounted for by
%   background models.
