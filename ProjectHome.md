using subvesrion for version controll
TortoiseSVN for windows to update commit import...
I think that I can use the svn under GNU/Linux stuff.
It is pretty cool to start playing with version controll...
I kindda like doing this. Maybe I sall find something that I really
love doing for the rest of my life. Don't be blind!
